inspired by [RGB-Color-Classifier-with-Deep-Learning-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow](https://github.com/AjinkyaChavan9/RGB-Color-Classifier-with-Deep-Learning-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow.git)

Deploy the deep learning inside FastAPI and Streamlit.
Training model file for deep learning is (colormodel_trained_90.h5). 
Both FastAPI and Streamlit using same training model file.
1. FASTAPI : main.py
2. Streamlit : home.py & color_classifier.py
